1. Wash or peel 5 lbs of white potatoes (in all other recipes I prefer yellow, but in this case white is much better).
2. Place on trivet in Instant Pot and add 1 cup of water.
3. Cook on high for 9 minutes and naturally release for 20 minutes.
4. Once cool, eat out of hand all day like the earth apples they are.
