1. Place eight marshmallows in a medium-sized microwavable bowl. Add a tablespoon of butter/margarine.
2. Microwave for 30 seconds.
3. Stir in the melted butter/margarine.
4. Microwave for another 15-30 seconds, but keep an eye on it. Turn off the microwave the second the mixture threatens to spill out of the bowl or touch the top of the microwave.
5. Immediately add 1 cup of Rice Krispies or your favourite cereal (Cinnamon Toast Crunch and French Toast Crunch are both amazing).
6. Stir until evenly mixed.
7. Enjoy with a spoon right out of the bowl.
